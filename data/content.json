        "content": "Netizens are calling for the resumption of the Chikkaballapur-Bengaluru Cantonment MEMU train service, which South Western Railway (SWR) discontinued in January 2025 due to low occupancy rates (below 2%). Citizens, particularly from northern Bengaluru, argue that the service is crucial for easing traffic congestion and providing better connectivity to the Metro and IT hubs like Whitefield. Bengaluru Central MP PC Mohan has also urged SWR to restart the trains, highlighting their potential to reduce pressure on routes like Hebbal and the Outer Ring Road. Despite this public demand, SWR stated that no proposals for restoring the MEMU service have been received so far.",
